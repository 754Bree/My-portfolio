    <div class="About">
        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p>I sat for my Kenya Certificate of Primary Education in the year 2015 and managed to join one of the best national girl schools in kenya,<em>MOI GIRLS HIGH SCHOOL ELDORET</em> in February,2016. Finaly  I sat my K.C.S.E in November 2019.
        Coming from a lineage where coding ran in the blood, I decided to follow in my fathers' footsteps and chose to join Moringa School where am currently enrolled as a Software Developer. As at now, I have been working on my own personal projects. However, I wouldn't mind working on other peoples projects, idealy companies either startups or already well-established ones. The <strong>Main</strong> reason behind programming is my undying passion for gaming. Many at times, I have played games that i did not enjoy because from my point of view wasn't put well together and at times there have been instances whereby the games crash or fail to open up.</p>
        <h3> HOBBIES </h3>
        <p> Well being a developer doesn't necesarrily entail being behind a computer screen an entire day,everyday,every year. It is advisable to take breaks every once in a while to engage in whatever activities one finds best suited for them. Well during my free time or breaktime, I enjoy : </p>
